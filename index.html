                <h2>The history of the Zoo</h2>
                <p>In 1980, the land which the Pine City Zoo encompasses was donated to the people
                    of the city of Pine City to be used for recreational use by the firm of the located
                    Zwide Zwane. Z. Zwane was involved in the development of the new mining town of
                    Pine City. He had 3-million trees planted in the area. 
                </p>
                <p>Since then, Pine City has developed and evolved over years. Public perception
                    of the Zoo changed in the 1990's when visitors wanted to see animals in larger,
                    more natural encloures. This was the start of the Zoo's long-term plans to grow
                    and improve the facility for both the animals and the visitors.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Did you Know?</b></h3>
                <p>The original animal collection consisted of one lion, one leopard,
                    one giraffe, two sable antelope bulls, one genet, one baboon, one pair of
                    Rhesus monkeys, one pair of porcupines and one Golden eagle.
                </p>

                <h1>OUR ANIMALS</h1>
                <br/>    
                <h2>BIRDS</h2>
                <img src="">
                <p>Birds are the most accomplished of all flying animals ans evolved from reptile
                    -like ancestors. (warm blooded) vertebrates, however, unlike most mammals, they lay
                    eggs.
                </p>
                <h2>CARNIVORES</h2>
                <img src="img/lion.jpg">
                <p>Although the term "carnivore" is used to describe an animal that eats meat,
                    it also refers specifically to the members of the order Carnivora. While
                    most members of this group eat meat, some have mixed diet and some are
                    almost completely herbivorous (Bears species).
                </p>
                <h2>FROGS AND REPTILES</h2>
                <p>The Zoo houses a wide variety of reptiles such a snakes, lizards, tortoises and
                    crocodiles as well as a number of amphibian species.

                <h2>HOOFED ANIMALS</h2>
                <p>Hoofed mammals are a highly successful group with their dominant
                    terrestrial herbivore postion being attributed largely to their
                    speed and endurance, and to the fact that they are well equipped
                    to break down the cellulose in their their plant diet.
